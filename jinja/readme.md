 With Jinja, you can build rich templates that power the front end of your Python web applications.

Create a Jinja template that displays a congratulatory message for students who pass the exam and a gentle, supportive message for those who do not pass.
Use Jinja's if-else conditional statements to make the message dynamic based on the student's score.
